In the first part of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) programme, 100,000 randomly selected people across England will be tested for antigens indicating the presence of the virus. 

In the second part of the programme (REACT-2), a number of different antibody tests will be assessed for their accuracy and ease of use at home. The antibody tests will first be carried out on volunteers from Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust who are known to have had the virus to establish their accuracy. Three hundred public volunteers will also be given a sample test to self-administer. If successful, the test will then be distributed to a larger cohort of up to 10,000 people. 

A further stage will involve up to 5,000 key workers, who will both self-test and have the test administered by a health professional. These results will also be compared with the results of blood samples from participants to provide more information about the accuracy of the tests. If antibody self-testing is found to work with a high degree of accuracy, acceptability and usability, it will be rolled out to 100,000 people later this year, to provide an indication of the prevalence of COVID-19 based on the presence of coronavirus antibodies.",Gov.uk_press release,Measures to limit spread,"Testing, surveillance and contact tracing",NA,Wider policies

Step one changes to policy come into effect on Wednesday 13 May in England,"[W]hile we hope for a [vaccine] breakthrough, hope is not a plan. A mass vaccine or treatment may be
more than a year away. Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine. So our
plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while
doing all we can to avoid that outcome.'","The strategy describes three phases to recovery and explains that we are leaving phase 1 and entering phase 2. The phases are (1) where the government sought to contain, delay, research and mitigate; (2) 'Smarter controls' - where existing restrictions are replaced with measures that have the largest effect on controlling the pandemic with the lowest health, economic and social cost. These will be announced in steps, with conditions for progressing through each step, and the option to reimpose restrictions; (3) 'Reliable treatment' - where the roll out of an effective treatment and/or vaccine allows us to move to a stage where the effects of the virus are reduced to a manageable level. The strategy describes a three-step 'roadmap to lifting restrictions'. Step one policies that apply from Wednesday 13 May in England include: (a) Work - workers from particular sectors who cannot work from home should travel to work if their workplace is open. Workplaces should follow the new “COVID-19 Secure” guidelines. (b) Schools - schools should urge more children who would benefit from attending in person to do so. Paid childcare can take place subject to being able to meet the public health principles. (c) Travel - everybody (including critical workers) should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible and social distancing guidance on public transport must be followed. (d) Face-coverings - people should aim to wear a face-covering in enclosed spaces. (e) Public spaces - as well as exercising as much as people like, people can now also drive to outdoor spaces and spend time outdoors subject to not meeting up with more than one person from outside their household and compliance with social distancing. Higher fines will be imposed to reflect the increased risk to others of breaking the rules.

The content and timing of the second and third stages of adjustments will depend on the most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus. 

Fourteen programmes of work support the delivery the plan, including NHS and care capacity and operating model, Protecting care homes, Shielding of the most vulnerable, and Accurate disease monitoring and reactive measures.

From 4 July people should: only gather indoors in groups of no more than two households, even when dining out or going to the pub; only gather outdoors in groups of up to six people from different households or up to two households; only gather in larger groups of up to 30 for life events; not hold or attend celebrations when it is difficult to maintain social distancing; not stay overnight away from home with members of more than two households; limit the number of people you see; and limit social interactions with anyone outside the group you are attending a place with.

Updated 26 June 2020.,"The review was undertaken because there are severe economic costs to maintaining two metre distancing and it make it not financially viable for many businesses to operate. Industry bodies estimate that outlets could only make 30% of pre COVID-19 revenues with two metre distancing. 9.2m jobs have been furloughed, including over 1.75m jobs in sectors currently closed. Some of the jobs are at risk if reopening not viable at two metres. Similar countries have also recommended distances below two metres when prevalence has fallen.","WhilE evidence shows that the relative risk may be two to ten times higher at one metre than two metres, mitigations can reduce the risk at one metre, so that it is broadly equivalent to being two metre apart. Guidance will change to state that ‘two metre or one metre with risk mitigation (where two metres is not viable) are acceptable’. Businesses should set out the mitigations they’ll introduce in their risk assessment. The COVID-secure risk assessment process already in place can be used to implement any change in guidance. SAGE has advised on 39 actions that can reduce risk of transmission, including: changing shift patterns so staff work in set teams; improving ventilation; changing room layouts to orientate people better; increase cleaning and handwashing; and encouraging use of protective screens and face coverings. Other mitigations include: limiting capacity; contactless purchases; one way systems; sending clear message to staff to stay home when symptomatic, or if a member of their household is symptomatic; and recording staff contact details and working patterns to support test and trace.

The review states that the social, economic, and health impacts of changing the two metres guidance are not evenly distributed, with people employed in closed sectors more likely to be young, not have a degree, and to work in low-skilled occupations.

Plan says government is preparing for different scenarios, but in all cases hope to 'see a return towards normality in spring 2021'. Government plan to continue to build the NHS Test and Trace service, and to increase antigen testing capacity to half a million tests a day by end of October. Government will also increase local health protection teams. The government is auditing critical winter stockpiles of equipment and PPE to ensure there is adequate stock. Plan outlines steps to ease restrictions from 1 August, provided prevalence remains low. The government will: give employers more discretion on whether to open workplaces; reopen most remaining leisure settings; enable the restart of indoor performances to a live audience; allow all close contact services to resume; pilot the return of spectators to live sport events, with plans for a full, socially-distanced return of audiences in stadia and conferences from 1 October; and enable wedding receptions for no more than 30 people. In September, schools, nurseries and colleges will open for all children and young people on a full-time basis. 'If prevalence falls very significantly', government will review outstanding measures and 'allow a more significant return to normality'. This would start with removing the need to distance people.

2020-07-17T00:00:00Z,275,"National Framework published for local authorities and local decison-makers setting how to prevent, contain and manage COVID-19 local outbreaks","Framework sets out how national and local partners, such as the NHS Test and Trace, the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC), local authorities, and Public Health England (PHE), will work with the public to prevent, contain and manage local COVID-19 outbreaks. Also outlines new regulations from 18 July that give local and national government additional powers to stop local transmission of the virus. Ministers are accountable nationally for setting this framework and Directors of Public Health are accountable for controlling local outbreaks. The guidance sets out six key principles for the effective implementation of an ‘integrated national and local system’: (1) primary responsibility is to make the public safe; (2) build on public health expertise and use a systems approach; (3) be open with data and insight; (4) build consensus between decision-makers; (5) follow well-established emergency management principles; and (6) consider equality, economic, social and health-related impacts of decisions.

Local outbreak plans are centred on 7 themes: healthcare and education settings; high-risk workplaces, communities and locations; local testing; contact tracing in complex settings; data integration; vulnerable people and diverse communities; and local boards and communications.

Where possible, actions to address local outbreaks will be undertaken in partnership with local communities. Local authorities will have the powers to close individual premises, public outdoor places and prevent specific events from the 18th July. Ministers have similar powers to take action against specific premises, places and events, as well as a power to ask local authorities to consider whether any actions have been unnecessary and should be revoked. To address more serious and wider-spread cases, ministers can use their existing powers (under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984) to implement more substantial restrictions. 

The framework sets out the local governance arrangements for COVID-19 outbreak plans. A table in the framework summarises the key roles for managing outbreaks within an individual setting, within a local authority area, and for those which cross regional boundaries. Local authorities deemed as areas for ‘enhanced support will be provided with increased national support, capacity and oversight, including additional resources deployed to augment the local teams’.",Gov.uk_guidance,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Measures to limit spread,Infection prevention and control,NA,Wider policies

To make a direction under these regulations a local authority must gather evidence that meets the following 3 conditions: it must be in response to a serious and imminent threat to public health; it must be necessary to prevent, protect against, control or respond to the incidence or spread of COVID-19; and it must be a proportionate means of achieving that purpose to prevent. Local authorities should consult the police prior to issuing a direction if it 'prohibits, requires or restricts access to a premise, event or public outdoor place that is situated against a Local Resilience Forum boundary’.

The guidance sets out measures to maintain service delivery and manage outbreaks, and advice on visitors and testing, and signposts providers to existing guidance on areas including risk assessments, supporting staff, infection prevention control and PPE. It states that ‘given the different types of supported living and the associated care, support and help for people living there, this guidance cannot be specific to individual locations’ so local managers should use it to inform the development of their own ‘specific ways of working’.
The guidance states that to maintain service delivery, supported living providers should: ensure that lists of people in supported living are up to date; develop business continuity plans to help them manage emergency situations; update risk management plans for people who may find changes in routine challenging; work with local authorities to facilitate mutual aid, care and support plans; identify people who use direct payments or fund their own support; avoid sharing staff between settings; identify people who are clinically extremely vulnerable; and maintain oversight for people who are self-isolating. 
To reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading across supported living facilities, measures should be followed, including social distancing, hygiene principles, self-isolation, use of PPE and cleaning. Staff should consider how the person they are supporting is most likely to understand the information and use the appropriate communication techniques. As lockdown measures continue to ease, providers should refer to guidance on ‘staying alert and social distancing’, which describes current options for meeting family members, friends and support bubbles. If there is any local tightening of lockdown measures, supported living settings in these locations are required to follow local guidelines. If a supported living worker has COVID-19 symptoms, they should refer to the guidance for ‘working safely during coronavirus’. If a worker comes into close contact with someone confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 while not wearing PPE, they should inform their line manager and refer to the guidance for the ‘management of exposed healthcare workers’. If a person in supported living develops a COVID-19 infection, plans should be developed to ensure that person is supported to have their health checked in case further interventions are needed. The Health Protection Teams at Public Health England have an essential role in responding any COVID-19 outbreaks in supported living settings. Any people living in supported living or staff can access a COVID-19 test. Any individual being discharged from hospital into a supported living setting should be supported as if they were ‘possibly COVID-19 positive’.

Outlines the new risk-assessed care pathway scenarios and key measures such as PPE use, extended use of face masks and coverings, and social distancing for these pathways. Patients now to be managed in 3 COVID-19 pathways – high risk (have or are likely to have COVID-19), medium risk (symptom free but no test result) and low risk (symptom free, a negative test result and have self-isolated prior to admission). Organisations should separate and minimise contact between these patient pathways and staff. Provides examples of patient groups and services that fall within each pathway. To enable early recognition of COVID-19 cases, screening and triaging should be undertaken 'prior to arrival at a care area, or as soon as possible on arrival, and allocated to the appropriate pathway'.  There is 'no change' in IPC recommendations when managing patients on a high risk pathway. Patients on a low risk pathway require 'Standard Infection Prevention & Control Precautions' for surgery or procedures.

The guidance says the government is ‘not recommending face coverings are necessary in education settings generally because a system of control, applicable to all education environments, provides additional mitigating measures’. However, school and colleges have the 'discretion' to require face coverings in indoor communal areas where ‘social distancing cannot be safely managed’. Eg in areas where the layout makes it difficult to maintain social distancing when students and staff are moving around, when these extra measures may provide additional confidence to parents and support the full return of students to school or college. Guidance says that face coverings can ‘have a negative impact on learning and teaching and so their use in the classroom should be avoided’. Where local restrictions apply in areas where transmission of COVID-19 is high, face coverings should be worn by adults and pupils when moving around indoors where social distancing is difficult to maintain.

However, where regions have natural boundaries, like an island, Grant Shapps says that the ‘Passenger Locator forms combined with NHS Test and Trace will give us a clear picture of where infections are coming from’. Therefore a new islands policy has been introduced. The data and capacity exists to be able to remove or add specific islands from quarantine. However, the islands this will apply too must collect robust, reliable and internationally comparable data, must have direct flights to the UK (or transport must have taken place through quarantine exempt territories), and FCDO travel advice should align as far as practicable.",Gov.uk news story,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Measures to limit spread,Travel measures,Statement on international travel corridors,Transport-specific policy

2020-09-11T00:00:00Z,302,Government announces that the NHS COVID-19 app will launch on 24 September in England and Wales – app includes QR check-in at venues,"The government announces the launch of the NHS COVID-19 app across England and Wales on 24 September. The app incudes a QR check-in at venues, so customers and visitors can check-in on entry to venues on their smartphones instead of filling out a check-in book or tool specific to the business. Businesses across England and Wales, including pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas, are being asked to ensure they have NHS QR code posters visible on entry so customers who have downloaded the new app can easily check-in. Universities, hospitals, leisure premises, civic centres and libraries are also being asked to display QR code posters in communal areas. The QR codes can be downloaded via a website to display as posters. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock says ‘QR codes provide an easy and simple way to collect contact details to support the NHS Test and Trace system’.

Businesses that already use their own QR system are being encouraged to switch to the NHS Test and Trace QR code. An alternative check-in method must be maintained to collect the contact details of those who don’t have the app. The press release states that ‘ongoing trials in Newham, on the Isle of Wight and with NHS Volunteer Responders show the app is highly effective when used alongside traditional contact tracing to identify contacts of those who have tested positive for coronavirus’.

New guidance sets out instructions on how to carry out the test, post the sample and get the results. It states that results take 3 to 7 days. Emphasises that it is currently only available to care workers in England and Wales.

All NHS staff and social care staff also continue to be able to assess testing at NHS test sites.

The guidance was subsequently changed. On 17 September, the link to the antibody testing service was removed and the guidance set out that the Department of Health and Social Care is working directly with organisations in the adult social care sector in order to offer tests.

2020-09-20T00:00:00Z,305,Government announces new legal requirements for self-isolation and measures to support and enforce this,"From 28 September, people will be legally required to self-isolate following a positive COVID-19 test result or being instructed by NHS Test and Trace to self-isolate due to contact with someone with a positive test result. To enforce self-isolation, this government will bring in new fines for those breaching the rules - starting at £1,000 and increasing to up to £10,000 for repeat offences or the ‘most egregious breaches, including for those preventing others from self-isolating’. NHS Test and Trace call handlers will make regular contact with people self-isolating and escalate suspicions of non-compliance to Local Authorities or police. Police resources will be used to check compliance in high incidence areas and risk groups - high-profile cases of non-compliance may be prosecuted. Government will introduce a payment of £500 for people on lower incomes who will lose income due to self-isolating. To be eligible, people must be: asked by NHS Test and Trace to self-isolate; unable to work from home so will lose income as a result of self-isolation; and claiming one or more of the following benefits - Universal Credit, Working Tax Credits, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, Pension Credit or Housing Benefit. The support scheme should be in place by 12 October, but eligible people can receive payments backdated from 28 September. Related guidance on self-isolating is updated to reflect the change.

Announcing this publication of the list in the House of Commons, Matt Hancock states that: 'I want to reinforce this important point: the system relies on people coming forward for tests if—and only if—they have symptoms of coronavirus or have been specifically advised to by a health professional.

2020-09-24T00:00:00Z,309,NHS Test and Trace launches the NHS COVID-19 App to help identify contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19,"The NHS COVID-19 app launches 'to help control COVID-19 transmission alongside national and local contact tracing', following 'positive trials and rigorous testing'. It is part of the NHS Test and Trace programme and will help identify contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19. The app is for anyone aged 16 and over, and is available in multiple languages. Major mobile network operators have confirmed that in-app activity will not come out of customers’ data allowance. The app's contact tracing feature uses Bluetooth to log the amount of time a person spends near other app users, and the distance between them, so it can alert a person if they have been close to someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. The app will advise people to self-isolate if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case. People can use the app to check symptoms, book a free test if needed, get test results, and check the level of COVID-19 risk in their postcode district. The app has a QR check-in for people to use to check-in at venues - it will alerts someone if they have recently visited somewhere they may have come into contact with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. Businesses legally have to display NHS Test and Trace QR codes for customers. The aim is that the app  'tracks the virus, not people' and uses data security technology to protect privacy. The app does not hold personal information such as names, addresses or dates of birth, and only requires the first half of anyone’s postcode to ensure local outbreaks can be managed. No personal data is shared with the government or the NHS.

2020-09-28T00:00:00Z,311,Government publishes a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Strategy setting out 'how government is preparing for a second wave of COVID-19',"The government publishes a new PPE strategy for England to 'stabilise and build resilience' from September 2020 to March 2021. Following an 'emergency response' approach to PPE during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the strategy sets out 'how government is preparing for a second wave of COVID-19'. To respond to future demand increases, the Department of Health and Social Care is building a 'strategic stockpile’ equivalent to around 4 months’ stock of each product category. Government is also reviewing stockpile requirements for future pandemics (not just COVID-19). Due to the ‘significant differences in the nature of the market for each category’ of medical-grade PPE, the Department of Health and Social Care is taking a category-by-category approach within the PPE strategy. A ‘robust plan’ has been developed to stand procurement and distribution back up at pace to provide an effective and timely response to any future need. Government is reviewing future COVID-19 PPE requirements to maintain the increased level of UK PPE manufacture, and anticipates that UK-based supply will meet 70% of forecasted demand in England in December for all types of PPE (less than 1% of PPE was manufactured in the UK pre COVID-19). Aiming to shift towards more sustainable and innovative PPE, PPE will be reusable by design going forward, where possible. The Department of Health and Social Care says it is ‘listening to the reported practical difficulties with the use of some PPE experienced by women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals’ and is taking action to ensure ‘user needs are adequately addressed in future provisions of PPE’.",Gov.uk press release,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Measures to limit spread,Infection prevention and control,NA,Wider policies
